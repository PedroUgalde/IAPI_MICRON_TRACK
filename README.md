Micron Technology is an American multinational company founded in 1978 in Boise, Idaho, specializing in the design, development and manufacturing of semiconductors.
It is known for its memory products, including DRAM, SDRAM, NAND flash memory, and solid storage systems (SSD).
The purpose of the project is to create a system in Python that automates the calculations necessary to balance production with demand, allowing more precise and efficient planning and reducing costs, using linear programming modeling.

## Before the code

First, we need to install Python Dependencies. We used Pandas, for data analysis, Numpy for maths, and PuLP, for our general model. 

### Installing

```
pip install pandas
```

```
pip install pulp
```

Numpy is already installed in your Python Distribution, but if you want to verify 

```
pip install numpy
```
